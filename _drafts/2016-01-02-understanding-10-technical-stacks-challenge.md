I've been working on the web development for a while, and I always wonder how people build awesome and crazy stuff(I'm sure a thing can be awesome and crazy at the same time). I always dream of building some thing cool and crazy technology like Google, Facebook, GitHub, Yahoo .. .. does.

We all know them as `Giant Whales` in the `tech Ocean` for their expertise, culture, technology. But I wanted to dig little more deep into the Ocean. So i started to work on understanding how they did it:

- the hurdles they faced
- the problems they fixed in between & solutions invented
- how they steered the techstack over years into the right directions
- the changes made in the architecture  

** I'm not considering the business model here, I'm only worried about the technology and stack **

Here is the Challenge - I want to study the above 4 points and may be other things too about

1. Google Search Engine
  - how the search is amazingly fast
  - how do they index the data
2. Twitter Messaging
  - realtime messaging system
  - realtime notifications
3. Travis CI
  - Continuous Integration and Deployment
4. Jenkins CI
  - Continuous Integration
  - CronJobs
5. GitHub
  - Hooks technology
  - Core technology to sync the files
