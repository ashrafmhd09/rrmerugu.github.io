These are more of learnings from different experiences  rather than mistakes in 2015. I'm sure I can do much better than what I've done in this year.

- Better decision making.
- Be serious about **The Time**.
- **Have a motive** for every move.
- Make better and more **realistic Business Plan**.
- **Socialize** with people.
