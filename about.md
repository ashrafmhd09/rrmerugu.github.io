I'm a biologist who fell in love with coding and computers. Since I come from Computational Drug Discovery research background, my relations with Linux and Cluster Computing technologies exists since the beginning.  I switch between a bunch of science and coding stuff.

I worked mostly with Computational Biologists & Chemists in the field of Computational Drug Discovery. I have been coding since 2010 at various programming languages starting from PHP to AngularJS & Django.
